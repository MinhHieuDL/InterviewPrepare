- A pointer allow to pass potentially large amounts of data around at low cost: instead of copying the data we simply pass its address as a pointer value
- The type of the pointer determines what can be done to the data through the pointer
- Using a pointer differs from using the name of an object in a few ways:
  - We use a different syntax, for example, ∗p instead of obj and p−>m rather than obj.m
  - We can make a pointer point to different objects at different times
  - We must be more careful when using pointers than when using an object directly: a pointer may be a nullptr or point to an object that wasn’t the one we expected
- These differences can be annoying; for example, some programmers find f(&x) ugly compared to f(x)
- Worse, managing pointer variables with varying values and protecting code against the possibility of nullptr can be a significant burden
- Finally, when we want to overload an operator, say +, we want to write x+y rather than &x+&y
- The language mechanism addressing these problem is called a _reference_
- Like a pointer, a reference is an alias for an object, is usually implemented to hold a machine address of an object, and does not impose performance overhead compared to pointers, but it differs from a pointer in that:
  - You access the reference with exactly the same syntax as the name of an object
  - A reference always refers to the object to which it was initialized
  - There is no "null reference", and we may assume that a reference refers to an object
- The main use of references is for specifying arguments and return values for functions in general and for overloaded operators in particular
- To reflect the lvalue/rvalue and const/non-const distinctions, there are three kinds of references:
  - _lvalue reference_: to refer to objects whose value we want to change
  - const reference: to refer to objects whose value we do not want to change (e.g., a constant)
  - rvalue reference: to refer to objects whose value we do not need to preserve after we have used it (e.g., a temporary)
- Collectively, they are called _references_. The first two are both called _lvalue references_
