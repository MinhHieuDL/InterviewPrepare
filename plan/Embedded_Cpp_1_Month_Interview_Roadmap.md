# ðŸ“… 1-Month Embedded C++ Interview Prep Roadmap (Markdown Checklist)

---

## âœ… Week 1: C++ Refresher (Modern C++ & OOP)

### ðŸ“˜ Topics to Review
- [ ] Object-oriented programming (OOP): inheritance, polymorphism, virtual functions
- [ ] Abstract classes and interfaces
- [ ] RAII and smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`)
- [ ] STL containers (`vector`, `map`, etc.)
- [ ] Move semantics and rvalue references
- [ ] Lambda functions, `auto`, `decltype`, `constexpr`
- [ ] Function wrappers: `std::function`, `std::bind`

### ðŸ›  Practice Tasks
- [ ] Solve 5 C++ problems on LeetCode or Exercism
- [ ] Implement a simple class hierarchy (e.g., Shape -> Circle, Square)
- [ ] Build a small app using `unique_ptr` and STL containers
- [ ] Browse `cppreference.com` and write notes on at least 3 STL components

---

## âœ… Week 2: Embedded & Low-Level Concepts

### ðŸ“˜ Topics to Review
- [ ] Memory layout: stack vs heap, static vs dynamic
- [ ] Pointers and pointer arithmetic
- [ ] `volatile`, const-correctness, and alignment
- [ ] Memory-mapped I/O and register access
- [ ] Interrupt handling basics
- [ ] Real-Time OS (RTOS) concepts: tasks, mutexes, semaphores

### ðŸ›  Practice Tasks
- [ ] Write a mock driver for a GPIO or UART device
- [ ] Implement a fixed-size circular buffer
- [ ] Review and document 3 useful Trace32 scripts or commands

---

## âœ… Week 3: Linux Development & Toolchain

### ðŸ“˜ Topics to Review
- [ ] File I/O: `open`, `read`, `write`, `ioctl`
- [ ] POSIX threads: `pthread_create`, mutex, condition variables
- [ ] Linux process model: `fork`, `exec`, signals
- [ ] Shared memory and pipes
- [ ] Writing Makefile and CMake from scratch
- [ ] Debugging tools: `gdb`, `valgrind`, `strace`, `perf`

### ðŸ›  Practice Tasks
- [ ] Build a multithreaded program using `pthreads`
- [ ] Debug a segmentation fault using `gdb` and analyze core dump
- [ ] Create a minimal Linux app with a custom `CMakeLists.txt`

---

## âœ… Week 4: Interview Prep & Mini Projects

### ðŸ“˜ Topics to Review
- [ ] Bit manipulation and memory access techniques
- [ ] System design for embedded subsystems
- [ ] Behavioral question framework (STAR)
- [ ] Common embedded C++ interview problems

### ðŸ›  Practice Tasks
- [ ] Implement a basic RTOS-like cooperative scheduler
- [ ] Simulate a UART driver with C++ classes and buffers
- [ ] Do 2 mock interviews (with peer or online)
- [ ] Prepare 3 STAR stories: debugging, team challenge, learning experience
